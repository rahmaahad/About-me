# About-me
I am a software engineering student looking to apply to apprenticeships. I have excellent communication skills developed at work experience; during my time as a receptionist at NHS I gained confidence, I became considerate of others and that helped me improve my communication skills, it gave me the ability to handle situations and as well as that I was able to successfully build on my patients care skills and I enjoy part as demonstrated by the extra-curricular activities I undertake. I am reliable, energetic and I have a positive attitude. Also, I can work under pressure and I can multi-task. I am always keen to learn new skills and therefore I would be looking for opportunities within the software industry to widen my experience and knowledge base further.
